# 2023-Reanimated-BP
Boiler plate for spinning up quick react-native projects with the new ARCH enabled, and reanimated / styled-components ready to go.

- Side Note: had to use `rbenv` to set my ruby version to `2.7.6` in the `/ios` folder, if issues continue after that set ruby version to '2.7.6' in the gem file in project root. 

# Setup 
- clone the repo into local dir 
- cd into repo 
- run yarn
- cd into the `/ios` folder 
- run pod install
- cd back into the project root 
- run yarn ios
